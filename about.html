              <h4> What is Conveyor Belt Sushi? </h4>
              <h5 class="subheader">Conveyor belt sushi, (also called sushi-go-round) mainly by foreigners living in Japan, is the popular English translation for Japanese fast-food sushi. In Australia, it is also known as sushi-train (as the sushi goes around a track on a train rather than a conveyor belt.) In South Korea, conveyor belt sushi has become popular and is known as “revolving sushi”. Kaiten-sushi is a sushi restaurant where the plates with the sushi are placed on a rotating conveyor belt that winds through the restaurant and moves past every table and counter seat. Customers may place special orders but most simply pick their selections from a steady stream of fresh sushi moving along the conveyor belt.  The final bill is based on the number and color of plates of the consumed sushi.</h5>

            <h4>History of Sushi</h4>
                <p>The origin of sushi is not Japan.  It is said that sushi was introduced into Japan in the 77th century from China.  People began making sushi to preserve fish by fermentation when there were no refrigerators.  Since salt and rice were needed in order to ferment fish, sushi became to be closely related to rice in Japan.  Then, it developed into current sushi which combines fish and rices.</p>

            <h4>Health and Sushi</h4>
                <p>Sushi is low in fat and is a very nutritious food.  A typical setting of 7-9 pieces contains about 300-450 calories.  The fish in sushi provides protein and can be a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.  Omega-3 fatty acids are not only a nutritional requirement of humans but also a fatty acid that shows promise in remediation of many ailments from which we suffer for lack of this essential fatty acid in our modern diet, including cardiovascular disease.</p>
